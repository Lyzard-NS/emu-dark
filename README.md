 Project since 2016
 Fully recoded version of the emulator with well more documented source and complete different and more modern C# syntax used.
 Server's usage is low, stable & solid.
 
#### Branch state:
* **(master)** Beta 5.1 _STABLE_
* **(update)** 5.1.X
 
##### Coding syntax
 I've simplifed absolutely everything as much as possible and most of the server is dynamic.
 As of now it takes no more than 1 line to add an asset / object / npc or whatsoever to the map.
 
##### Current Emulator Developers

I've organized this Repo for anyone that joins to work with me and so you'll be able to understand what I've actually coded and the reason of me to do so. Also you might find a better solution for my code & improve it this way =)
